          <h2>24 Chicken</h2>
          <div class = "review-container">
          <p>I had the worst dining experience ever at this restaurant. The service was abysmal; it took forever to get a menu,
            and our order was messed up multiple times.
            The staff seemed disinterested and unprofessional. The ambiance was
            equally disappointing the place was dimly lit and had an unpleasant odor. When our food finally arrived, it was cold, and 
            the presentation was lackluster. To top it off, the prices were exorbitant for the quality we received.
            I won't be coming back.

        <h2>Kanto Freestyle</h2>
        
        <div class = "review-container">
        <p>This restaurant was a letdown. While the service was decent, the food left much to be 
          desired. I ordered their signature dish, and it was bland and overcooked. The portion 
          size was small for the price, making it a poor value. The ambiance was pleasant, but the
          noise level was quite high, making it hard to have a conversation. The dessert we
          ordered wasn't any better, and I expected more from a place with such a reputation. I
          might give it another chance, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to a friend.
