        <p>This restaurant was a letdown. While the service was decent, the food left much to be 
          desired. I ordered their signature dish, and it was bland and overcooked. The portion 
          size was small for the price, making it a poor value. The ambiance was pleasant, but the
          noise level was quite high, making it hard to have a conversation. The dessert we
          ordered wasn't any better, and I expected more from a place with such a reputation. I
          might give it another chance, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to a friend.
