        <h2>24 Chicken</h2>
        <div class = "review-container">
        <p>I had the worst dining experience ever at this restaurant. The service was abysmal; it took forever to get a menu,
          and our order was messed up multiple times.
          The staff seemed disinterested and unprofessional. The ambiance was
          equally disappointing the place was dimly lit and had an unpleasant odor. When our food finally arrived, it was cold, and 
          the presentation was lackluster. To top it off, the prices were exorbitant for the quality we received.
          I won't be coming back.

      <p>Wow, what an amazing dining experience! 
        Finally, this restaurant exceeded all of my expectations. The service was impeccable, 
        with a knowledgeable and attentive staff that made our evening truly special. 
        The food was exceptional, bursting with flavors and presented beautifully. 
        The menu offered a wide variety of options, catering to all tastes. 
        The ambiance was cozy and inviting, providing the perfect setting for a memorable meal. 
        While it's not the most budget-friendly place, the quality and overall experience make it worth every penny. 
        I can't wait to return!

            <p>I had a fantastic time at this restaurant. 
              The service was friendly and efficient, and the food was delectable. 
              The chef's creations were a delight to the taste buds, and the portion sizes were just right. 
              The menu was diverse, offering something for everyone, and the prices were reasonable for the quality. 
              The ambiance was cozy and well-lit, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The only reason 
              I didn't give it a perfect score was that it was quite busy, and we had to wait a bit for our table. 
              Nevertheless, I highly recommend this place.
